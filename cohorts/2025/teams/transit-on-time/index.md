The On-Time Transit Analytics project examined Automatic Passenger Counter (APC) and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) data to identify trends in late arrivals for a high-volume bus route. The team blended multiple years of historical datasets, standardized timestamps, and joined vehicle telemetry to understand delay hotspots.

## Key Findings

* Late arrivals clustered during evening peak hours, particularly in the downtown corridor.
* Weather events and special downtown activities correlated with service disruptions.
* Stop-level dwell times provided early warning signals for cascading delays.

## Impact

* Recommendations informed dynamic dispatch scheduling and additional operator support for peak times.
* Austin Transportation is piloting real-time alerts for route supervisors informed by the team's dashboard.
* The methodology serves as a blueprint for future reliability analyses across Capital Metro routes.

## Next Steps

1. Integrate predictive analytics to anticipate late arrivals based on live telemetry.
2. Extend the dashboard to cover accessibility metrics, including ramp deployment frequency.
3. Formalize data-sharing agreements to streamline future cohort projects involving APC and AVL datasets.
