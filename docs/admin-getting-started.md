# DIVE Gallery Admin Getting Started Guide

This guide walks delegated coordinators through the full lifecycle of managing a DIVE cohort without touching local tooling. Everything happens in GitHub’s web interface and the automation handles the rest.

---

## 1. Access & Preparation
- Ensure you have **write access** to the `cityofaustin/dive-gallery` repository.
- Review the existing cohort structure under `cohorts/<year>/` to understand the content model.
- Subscribe to repository notifications so you see pull requests (PRs) generated by automation.

---

## 2. Start a New Cohort Year
1. In GitHub, open the **Actions** tab.
2. Run the workflow **“Scaffold new cohort year”**.
   - Provide the four-digit year (e.g., `2026`).
   - The workflow opens a PR with:
     - `cohorts/<year>/index.md` – cohort landing page with placeholder intro.
     - `_data/cohorts/<year>.yml` – schedule, materials, and policies scaffold.
     - An empty `cohorts/<year>/teams/` directory.
3. Review the PR:
   - Update the cohort intro text in `cohorts/<year>/index.md`.
   - Populate policies or default materials in `_data/cohorts/<year>.yml` if you already have them.
4. Merge the PR when ready. The year is now active but empty.

---

## 3. Manage the Cohort Schedule
Use the **“Update cohort schedule”** issue form to edit the timeline displayed on the cohort page.

1. Go to **Issues → New issue → Update cohort schedule**.
2. Fill in:
   - `Cohort year` (e.g., `2026`).
   - The YAML list of events (each requires `name` and `date`; optional fields include `time`, `location`, `description`, `type`, `state`, `icon`).
3. Submit the issue. A workflow will:
   - Parse and validate the YAML.
   - Open a PR updating `_data/cohorts/<year>.yml`.
4. Review the PR diff, make any edits inline if needed, and merge.
5. Close the issue once merged. Re-open or create a new schedule issue for future changes.

> Tip: Leave extra events in draft (remove them from the YAML) until dates are confirmed. Re-running the issue form overwrites the events list, so treat it as the source of truth.

---

## 4. Add and Maintain Team Pages
Teams are created from the **“Add team (creates PR)”** issue template.

1. Go to **Issues → New issue → Add team (creates PR)**.
2. Complete every field—especially the team name, summary, coach info, and member list.
3. Submit the issue. The workflow will:
   - Create `cohorts/<year>/teams/<slug>/index.md` populated with front matter.
   - Open a PR with the new team page and placeholder asset references.
4. In the generated PR:
   - Use the GitHub web editor to update narrative content under the YAML front matter.
   - Upload real assets (`poster.pdf`, `idea-sheet.pdf`, `thumb.jpg`) directly into the team folder. Until the poster exists, the thumbnail workflow will skip that team.
5. Merge the PR to publish the team page.

### Editing Existing Teams
- Navigate to `cohorts/<year>/teams/<slug>/index.md` in GitHub.
- Click the pencil icon to edit YAML fields or narrative content.
- Commit the change to a new branch and open a PR as usual.
  - The validation workflow will confirm required metadata.

---

## 5. Upload Cohort Materials & Policies
1. Open `_data/cohorts/<year>.yml` in GitHub.
2. Update the `materials` section with links to handbooks, slide decks, or workshop resources.
   - Keep entries grouped (e.g., `essentials`, `workshops`).
   - Use fully qualified URLs or site-relative paths (`/assets/...`).
3. Adjust `policies` as needed—each bullet displays in the cohort sidebar.
4. Commit via PR for review.

---

## 6. Seasonal Workflow Checklist
**Kickoff**
- Scaffold the new year.
- Publish initial schedule, policies, and any onboarding materials.
- Collect initial team submissions via the issue template.

**Mid-Coaching**
- Update schedules (workshops, midpoint check-ins) via the issue form.
- Encourage teams to refresh summaries and dashboards as progress is made.
- Monitor GitHub Actions: `Validate Content` should stay green on team PRs.

**Poster Season**
- Teams upload `poster.pdf`; once merged, the **Generate poster thumbnails** workflow creates `thumb.jpg` automatically.
- If a poster replaces an older version, the workflow regenerates the thumbnail.
- Verify that each team page displays the new assets correctly.

**Final Review**
- Run the **Weekly Smoke Build** workflow on demand to ensure the site builds cleanly.
- Spot-check schedules, materials, and team pages for accuracy.
- Close outstanding schedule/team issues when the cohort transitions to archive mode.

---

## 7. After the Active Season
- Leave the cohort content as-is to serve as an archive.
- Use branch protection to prevent accidental pushes to `main`.
- Optionally, export a snapshot by running `npm run build` and downloading `_site/`.
- For the next season, repeat this guide starting at section 2.

---

### Support & Troubleshooting
- **Validation fails on a PR:** open the workflow logs to see missing front matter or oversized files, update accordingly, and re-run.
- **Schedule issue reports “No changes detected”:** ensure the YAML array actually differs from the current file; the automation skips redundant updates.
- **Need to re-run automations:** for poster thumbnails or schedule updates, re-trigger the respective workflow from the **Actions** tab.

You’re now ready to shepherd a DIVE cohort through kickoff, delivery, and archival using the built-in GitHub automations. Reach out to the engineering maintainer if you encounter edge cases not covered here.
